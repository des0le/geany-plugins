About
=====

`Cycle-Autocomplete` is a plugin for the Geany text editor that provides inline autocompletion based on the words in the current document.


Features
--------

- Inline autocompletion to be triggered manually
- Keybindings for cycling back and forth through completions
- Exact and fuzzy word matching
- Configuration options


Usage
=====

To make use of this plugin you first need to define keybindings for `Cycle autocomplete forward` and `Cycle autocomplete backward` in Geany's keybinding preferences.

.. note::
    To use `Escape` as trigger key you have to manually type ``Escape`` into the shortcut entry since the `Change` dialog will not work properly in this case.

Unlike Geany's default autocompletion mechanism, `Cycle-Autocomplete` does not pop up a menu with viable options, but completes the current word inline. Repetitive invocation of `Cycle autocomplete forward` or `Cycle autocomplete backward` cycles through the list of matching options in the specified direction.

The list of completions contains all words of the document that share a common prefix with the word currently under the cursor. If no words fulfil that condition, the list is extended by a fuzzy matching algorithm, such that e.g. ``acpl`` would yield ``auto_complete`` and ``AutoCompletion`` but not ``appliance``.

By default `Cycle-Autocomplete` presents those completions first that are closest to the current word. The plugin's preference pane offers an option to change this to alphabetic order.

In case you encounter performance issues or wish to have tighter control over the list of completions, you may limit the number of matches and set up a radius to restrict the search to words within a certain boundary.

.. note::
    A search radius of ``0`` executes the search on the whole document.

You may further opt to skip the fuzzy matching if exact matches are found.

When completing a word and the cursor is not positioned at the end, it can be specified whether or not to keep the trailing word part.
